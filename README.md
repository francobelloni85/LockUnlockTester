# Windows Kiosk Simulator

This program tries to emulate the behaviour of windows kiosk. 
it is possible to disable the USB, the navbar, the taskbar, the combination of keys etc. 

The program calls a library that must be compiled to 64 bit and also relies on Microsoft Devcon which must be included in the same folder to be invoked from the shell.

There are 3 ways to disable the UBS: Register API and Devcon.exe

More information in the readme.txt inside the library

Tested in visual studio 2019
